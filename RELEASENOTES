	- Removed bucket size option from `cf.init`
		The reasoning being that the option makes more sense once we decide that 
		we also want to parametrize the fingerprint size as the two options 
		are intertwined (bigger bucket size <==> longer fingerprints). 1 byte 
		fingerprints and 4 buckets work well together (cf. the paper) so it's 
		good enough for now and makes the interface more appealing.
		This also changed how the filter is saved to disk so the module will 
		refuse to load 0.1 filters. No backwards compatibility is going to be 
		implemented until we reach 1.0
